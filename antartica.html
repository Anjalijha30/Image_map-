<h1>Antartica</h1>
<h2>Antarctica, the southernmost continent and site of the South Pole, is a virtually uninhabited, <br>ice-covered landmass. Most cruises to the continent visit the Antarctic Peninsula<br> which stretches toward South America. It’s known for the Lemaire Channel and Paradise Harbor, <br>striking, iceberg-flanked passageways, and Port Lockroy, a former British research station turned museum.<br>The peninsula’s isolated terrain also shelters rich wild life, including many penguins.</h2>
